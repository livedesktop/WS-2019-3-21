Meet and collect tons of funny characters with their own unique personalities, like the portly Sergeant Cakemore, or the uber-macho builder guy, Forest Manly (whose real skill is the tiny bit too suggestive eyebrow raise).\r\n- Build a water tower. Check! Build a fire station. Check! But who’s going to drive the fire truck? Assigning citizens to jobs will help you optimize your city, but you can go even further! Send them on missions and they won’t come home empty handed or do favors for them so they would invite their friends too to fill your city!\r\n\r\nFusion is the way to go\r\n- The future: age of smart forks, exploding hover boards, even selfies! But now the 21st century lives up to its promise, with the ability to merge buildings into advanced skyscrapers and unlock specializations.\r\n- Unlocking each allows you to develop your city towards different directions and expand your collection with specialized buildings such as Sustainability, Commerce, Education and Entertainment. Choose which one suits your strategy best!\r\n\r\nThe grass is always greener…\r\n- But is it really? Find out by visiting the cities of your friends. Is your friend the best builder you know? Well, you can always “borrow” a bit of their ideas to improve your game … sshhh, we won’t tell anyone…\r\n- In case you find yourself short on some crucial resources, visiting the Trade HQ should be a

Be the firefighter & rescue services guy and save lives. You need to drive the fire truck in a big urban city and respond to emergency situations. Use the water gun to put out the fire. The fire brigade department also runs a first aid unit. Drive the ambulance in the city and reach the emergency scene quickly to make sure the injured people get medical attention. It is an emergency rescue simulation game so you can think of yourself as a firefighter from fdny or a fire fighter from San Francisco fire department. Just make sure you drive carefully and don’t bump into traffic and fixtures as it will only add delays and injured people are depending upon you. The fire truck and ambulance are ready for firefighting and rescue duty.\r\n\r\nDrive rescue and emergency vehicles in the urban city. Fire extinguishing can be tricky so make sure you throw the water with pressure and keep the direction of the water gun steady. Keep the fire truck emergency siren on and speed away. Rush towards the emergency scene to save the day and be the superhero fireman. Use your water gun to put the fire out sensibly as you will also have to collect water from multiple points to fill up the fire truck. Since it is a big urban city, there can be various fires and emergency situations. A fire in a high rise building, an air plane landing gear on fire, fire caused due to a traffic accident – all these emergency situations can arise in a big urban city and it is your duty to make sure you respond to all these emergency situations by driving the fire truck in time for rescue.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH67VP7","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Car Transporter Trailer Truck - City Cars Supplier","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22394.13510798886644298.b26a2dcc-f967-453a-be66-910d731cb818.13b75482-b476-4ff9-851e-3b44246d0f2b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46896.13510798886644298.f5f34637-dcc4-40e8-932f-3ced74722dff.aec4e377-d7f8-4920-bf0f-534c1a49f2a9","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41160.13510798886644298.357b1754-9102-4d21-a118-5e52701478b6.71e16a04-406a-445d-86d8-f550139f6997","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25069.13510798886644298.f20ff1e7-9df6-4e9a-9d3c-e56e2f06a982.75fe9ba6-97db-4c2c-85be-cfdf1fcb1ce8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["14859AppStreamStudios.CarTransporterTrailerTruck-C_ykgtwtztg31z8"],"ContentIds":["79c8b000-cdad-d0b1-dbce-7e00a3bf7be1","a5a11ab6-2866-e011-3626-e47aa5c83801"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Time to shift gears like a pro car transporter truck driver.

Either King or 2 can go on top of the Ace (and vice versa). \r\n- If you are unable to move any card you can open a close card. \r\n- Every time you move a card from layout to open card you get points.

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDNBQB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spider Solitaire+","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16409.9007199266465953.4da1e56c-28fe-4f92-9659-c12d5cefcdb9.416d55f6-68eb-4bf9-91d3-718a75a11b9c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61468.9007199266465953.4da1e56c-28fe-4f92-9659-c12d5cefcdb9.d0071eb4-2c02-4f1d-9171-81d30d10b7d9","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["12291raymond.li.916491D5F770_szs6zaftcmqhc"],"ContentIds":["9d460fbc-8a4b-0cf9-4fa3-0caeb7e27aa3","0dbaf4dc-82bb-1298-1409-604edb7d5a9d","40a33506-bb5d-a36b-8a18-dff9545c9aac"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Best spider solitaire game.
