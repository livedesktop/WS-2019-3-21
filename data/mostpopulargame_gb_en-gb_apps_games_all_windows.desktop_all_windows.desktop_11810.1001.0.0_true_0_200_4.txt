Restore the balance between Light and Darkness! Build towers and traps using technologies of Orcs, Goblins and Necromancers.\r\nShow your tactical skills combining various towers' effects and using terrain features. Protect the stronghold of the Dark Forces from the onslaught of hostile armies of Light!\r\n\r\nNOTICE: If you have problems running the game please contact us (and please specify your device model): wp7.smartpixgames@gmail.com\r\nFAQ: http://www.smartpixgames.com/faq.php#p10\r\nPromo video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRz9-Zf0flk\r\n\r\nIn the full version of Myth Defense: Dark Forces:\r\n- 4 maps + random map in battle mode\r\n- campaign: 10 + 50 missions and 2 modes to pass it: Normal and Heroic\r\n- achievements, increasing amount of Glory Points for mission\r\n- different skills improvement \r\n- 22 types of towers and 3 types of traps in 3 technological branches (Orcs, Necromancers, Goblins)\r\n- special features of monsters and towers\r\n- runes to make towers stronger, and Alchemy to create runes\r\n- terrain features: difficult terrain, moving platforms, etc.\r\n- 40 levels of hardness. The higher the level, the greater the reward\r\n- multilingual interface\r\n- original panoramic sound and music\r\n- additional DLC maps and campaigns with new enemies and towers\r\n- online worldwide leaderboards\r\n\r\nWe hope that Light Forces commanders, who loved the first part of Myth Defense, will be pleasantly surprised by the innovations in this part:\r\n• Enemies are now divided into classes: Live, Machine and Magic. Some towers affects only units of one class.\r\n• Moving platforms on the battlefield where you can build towers. Platform with a tower will move as close as possible to enemy units and attack them.\r\n• Some units (Dwarf and Paladin) wear armor. Armor absorbs 80% of low physical damage. Armor threshold is shown in the unit description which you can see by tapping on an enemy unit on the field. If tower causes more physical damage than the armor threshold, the armor breaks down and the unit gets full damage value. Armor doesn't protect units from other types of damage (fire , magic, etc)\r\n• Several fundamentally new towers:\r\n  - Fear Tower: scares enemy units, forcing them to run away from the tower for a while. One enemy can be scared only once (though some units are fearless).\r\n  - Cursed Tower: normally it shoots causing a base damage but can be charged with coins to temporarily multiply its power. If the health of the enemy unit does not exceed the base damage, the tower will kill it without spending extra-points. If the unit is strong tower will try to kill it, spending no more than enough extra-points.\r\n  - Jet Mace: shoots with a large spiked ball horizontally or vertically. It strikes several enemy units losing some destructive power each time. The ball continues to fly until it loses all the energy.\r\n  - Radioactive towers (Uranium and Plutonium): do not shoot, but continuously irradiates all units within damage radius. Golems and infected (by Plague or Poison Spider Tower) units are vulnerable to radiation.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH680N9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fire: Ungh's Quest","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18068.13510798886656070.f4bfe227-c95e-415c-9fcd-c2c20a63eb9b.9a050282-3b5f-407e-9156-4966fb1e15eb","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46631.13510798886656070.13cd6acf-85f5-4663-bf41-45b4fbc5c0e7.53654259-d0a6-458f-a582-a3b7f7d7d48b","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23883.13510798886656070.1ad2fc27-c995-4434-9240-7297d6319545.21e9ed95-ed3b-4fff-b55a-b6e5c4b8f60d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10213.13510798886656070.2a82dc16-095e-4b33-8a04-c4cfd0b0d4be.95df7de5-2157-4e2d-96bf-d071f75c93c7","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48470.13510798886656070.04b2b62d-768b-4a68-ac57-5e5a4633bbc6.ee4ae6a7-bbe1-4d7e-9174-a7dac6c89645","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63599.13510798886656070.fbbed91b-6e46-4301-8b37-b009dbc690ee.afe25061-869b-40f9-ba7f-cbade8f3be8f","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16362.13510798886656070.5ea0de71-fdde-4735-b336-9c296a8bdc73.dfef637d-7568-46a2-bd7c-26b1376e59f5","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40489.13510798886656070.cf4a4b0d-6c57-4779-92b4-84ebcff9d7fa.8ee68c4f-a415-47c1-9fa0-f9bf635a8a22","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32389.13510798886656070.3cb8afda-46ec-4826-a69b-d2779e61e125.31f11e9f-1f16-49c5-a739-21a0fdd6fe30","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46172.13510798886656070.c957cff1-a591-475f-9f69-f103b75c34f2.88e8fa6c-9e6a-437e-a89e-9c21026bb1a0","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£2.49","Price":2.49,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"11","PackageFamilyNames":["DaedalicEntertainment.FireUnghsQuest_9w6n57xt7hhbc"],"ContentIds":["a06c8fcb-5fcd-37cf-7a98-806d4d6ef61c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FIRE is a puzzleventure with intuitive puzzle design.

New graphics! We will continue updating the game. Thank you for your support of independent game developers! \r\n\r\nUse your periscope to target and destroy enemy ships. Join our big submarine patrol team. Be on our submarine! \r\n\r\nLegend says: The year was 1982. Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic. The British sent an expeditionary force to retake the islands. \r\n\r\nIn Submarine Patrol, you will relive this era as a leader of a submarine that patrols the islands and destroys enemy battleships.   \r\n\r\nTarget well before you shoot! Remember, you have a limited number of torpedoes on board. You cannot immediately fire one torpedo after another. \r\n\r\nIt takes 2-3 seconds to prepare the next torpedo.

The 2019 edition of Bridge features faster and stronger game play with smoother user interface.\r\n\r\nBridge is a card game played by four players who form two partnerships. Players within a partnership face each other across the bridge table. Traditionally, the players are referred to by the points of the compass - North, East, South and West. The two partnerships are North/South and East/West. Games are played to the best of three.  During bidding, each partnership exchanges information to decide a contract. Once established the cards are played with the declarer attempting to fulfill the contract + the opponents attempting to defeat it.\r\n\r\nBridge includes the all new state of the art advanced Bridge card play engine playing at a significantly stronger level. By analysing the probable permutations of the remaining cards Bridge will frequently find an extra trick to make or defeat a contract. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

Happy retro gaming!\r\n\r\nCash Lines, The Fruit Machine can be played by touching the onscreen buttons or by using a mouse-which covers most devices so happy retro gaming, all you need to provide is some real luck...\r\n\r\nTo add coins/credits to the fruit machine simply tap or click the red coin slot (Found above the game board features). Each tap/click of the coin slot will add four credits to the fruit machine, then just play the fruit machine like you normally would do. Please note-the coin slot will become inactive if you have ninety six credits in the fruit machine or more-until some of those credits are used, then the coin slot will become active again. The coin slot will also become inactive if you have one hundred pounds or more in the bank of the fruit machine-once that bank has been collected the coin slot will become active again.\r\n\r\nThe main features of Cash Lines, The Fruit Machine include;\r\n\r\n-Mystery Bonus Features-(When the trail is on number four or number ten you can select a random mystery bonus feature which may help you to either get a prize win or increase the trail number you are currently on, depending on the feature and most of the time they are a real help to the player. The mystery bonus features available are-In no real order-Respin, Stoppa, Boost, Skill Stop, Selector, Numbers in View, Reel Skill, Number Run and Golden Hold).\r\n\r\n-Trial Nudges, Gamble and Shuffle-(When the trail is on numbers sixteen to twenty seven you will be offered nudges which you can gamble in an attempt to win more or shuffle the reels at the cost of one nudge). \r\n\r\n-Trail Auto Nudge-(When the trail number is on a nudge amount and there is a prize win available within that nudge amount for the reels you are on, you will be offered that prize win and an auto nudge to that prize win. The auto nudge will automatically offer the largest prize win available for the nudge amount and the reels you are on which is a real help to the player and ensures the player is offered the highest prize win possible for the circumstances and if collected, the auto nudge will also use the nudges and automatically nudge to the prize win offered).\r\n\r\n-Trial Jackpot Gold Run Repeater-(When the trail is on number twenty eight you will win the Jackpot and a random amount of steps on the Gold Run, which will repeat the Jackpot if you spin a successful Gold Run, so the more steps you have on the Gold Run, the more real the chance of a successful repeat).\r\n\r\n-Prize Win Gamble, Game Board Feature offer and Game Board Feature Shuffle-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine, you will be offered a prize win gamble, except in the case of Jackpot wins and you’ll be offered an exchange to a game board feature and you’ll be offered a game board feature shuffle. Here you can either gamble your prize win, take the game board feature offered or shuffle the game board feature where it’ll offer a new game board feature. You’ll be offered a free shuffle under certain circumstances and in conditions where there isn’t a free shuffle available and the shuffle is used it will reduce the prize win by one. The greater the prize win amount, the more real the chance you’ll be offered a better game board feature.\r\n\r\nThere are many more features like holds, trail held(s) and of course the Gold Run and the game board features themselves-which are too many to list and explain in detail but include prize win repeaters and features like Cash Flash along with the BIG features like the Jackpot Repeater, Mega Cash Repeater, Graphic Cash Repeater etc- for those lucky enough to be offered them.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCM9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"FreeCell FREE","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.48618.9007199266251384.2dcfba61-94c3-4394-a846-dcaa94bc8671.5d0be557-841d-44ee-9634-13e0df5ef7a4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.30966.9007199266251384.4b5da019-614e-4b5a-b6ea-b5c548aa6d68.4af8b082-b084-48de-b45a-c2fce48619d5","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.28963.9007199266251384.817824bc-dd11-47c0-a0cf-fc00b1bb99c1.340d6d81-099a-4a5e-867f-36e5e98e0a5f","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14517.9007199266251384.3e14ddb7-ae2b-4950-892f-c459ccdbbb7a.ddb94a09-61ad-4a43-bb22-728954e7a54a","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33537.9007199266251384.1ab85fae-984f-4414-8bb5-b56c34f11f94.07514fba-4784-4d6e-b4a8-964c913df5b1","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.9675.9007199266251384.612bbb78-f106-4f04-86bb-127251f68ecb.8e0da3bc-fded-4206-8f4e-309c9f630eed","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63416.9007199266251384.d41846a3-b1b9-4264-a933-34775222864c.2e2961dd-2df8-4ae3-abd6-963afc434cf2","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63069.9007199266251384.74583e73-2f41-4a37-906d-ec1b04ee78df.a5a49040-f3ea-41fe-b01f-b64f459b5efb","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.1,"RatingsCount":"59","PackageFamilyNames":["43248SummitDataCorp.FreeCellFREE_hmd3687kaknfw"],"ContentIds":["879e8a4f-0616-3d31-efc0-98540111e473","fdab1588-239a-258a-91a5-5244269285f3","fefb2add-6e80-2de1-db22-abbc2b7f4d41"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FreeCell FREE contains all the features of a traditional FreeCell, plus the beautiful graphics made by CardLion.

Plan is a puzzle adventure game that takes place entirely inside an elevator.

Walk around the elevator, grab things, and press buttons! Or if you'd rather enjoy your buttons from a distance, you can play seated or standing with a variety of control options. \r\n\r\nClassic Genre, New Paint\r\nFloor Plan takes mechanics from your favorite classic point-and-click adventure games and reimagines them for first person VR. Whether you dream of inventory puzzles or you're a newcomer to the genre, you'll see it like you've never seen it before.\r\n\r\nPlay Your Way\r\nFigure out alternate solutions to puzzles, solve them in different orders, or call the operator if you need a nudge in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT\r\nFloor Plan generally takes players about an hour to complete. We've priced it accordingly, and think it has enough special moments to be memorable and something you'll want to share with friends.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH3ZTPP","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Shred It!

This will facilitate the transportation of passengers on the buses, as the buses require fuel and servicing. Purchase a variety of bus models, based on their fuel type and consumption.

At any time, you can upgrade your bus stations, in order to accommodate more passengers. Moreover, you can sell used vehicles to buy new and even more advanced ones.\r\n \r\nYour vehicles fuel up automatically if a road connection is available to the central gas station. But, at some point your vehicles will have to be serviced. You will have to send them to a service center (go to service), otherwise breakdowns will occur more frequently, eventually resulting in the loss of your vehicle. Road cracks also appear sometimes causing damage to your buses, so keep your roads maintained and clear of cracks. \r\n\r\nKey game features: \r\n- transport passengers between bus stations \r\n- a variety of bus models \r\n- upgrade stations to large bus hubs\r\n- upgrade gas station to offer different fuel types \r\n- beautiful night and day graphics, automatic or manual settings\r\n- build road network freely \r\n- build traffic lights to each junction\r\n- automatic breakdown generation\r\n- automatic road crack generation\r\n- various demolishing tools\r\n\r\nThe developer's notes:\r\nIf you liked the game, please provide us with feedback or a review and rate the game.

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4NMD9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Family Chess","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65476.13510798887476506.2f6d4dee-b5a5-4fb1-9703-d9753ab0501b.62f9fecb-8334-447b-b2b2-b81fc3875d96","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37386.13510798887476506.cdf27efa-8717-49fb-a8a5-459e4c5829a2.427c199d-e390-4418-a3f8-4f123f1774bb","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16552.13510798887476506.aaf081e3-e3ea-4dd8-99ea-a3e71ab3bef4.7b63e902-ade3-49e5-9be3-c4150de9fe61","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56306.13510798887476506.b0957bb6-8413-494c-b815-77be440696bd.366b209a-767d-467b-8310-68d22940c6a4","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.69","Price":1.69,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["ZingMagicLimited.362757324D423_ekfg0vgp37mkp"],"ContentIds":["0cbbe42a-6fa7-b591-88c2-008a3254d975"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Regardless of your playing level, ZingMagic's multi award winning Chess is a fun, stimulating and challenging game for beginners and champions alike.\r\n\r\nChess is a two player game with a colourful history which can be traced back to its Indian ancestor, Chaturanga. In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.

Sicily in 1943.\r\n\r\nOperation Husky was the code name for the invasion of Sicily in July 1943. This was the first return, in earnest, of the Western Allied powers to the continent of Europe since the disastrous withdrawal of the BEF from France in 1940.\r\n\r\nTwo armies were involved: The US 7th Army, commanded by Patton, and the British 8th Army, commanded by Montgomery. They faced a variety of Axis formations, from demoralised Italian coastal defences to tougher German mechanised troops, remnants of the Afrika Corps and Italian elites.\r\n\r\nThis game allows you to play either the Allied invasion, or the Axis defenders. The aim of the Allies is to capture the 3 principle cities of Sicily (Catania, Palermo and Messina) as quickly as possible. The Axis must prevent this.\r\n\r\nYou can either play another person hot-seat, or either side against your device.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 options you can set:\r\nAllied reinforcements: Fewer than historical, or more reinforcements from the historical floating reserves.\r\nAxis reinforcements: Fewer than historical, or more German and Italian reinforcements could be sent.\r\nLanding site: The historical site chosen was not the original one - there was an alternative Western site.\r\n\r\nIn all, there are 147 selectable combinations, plus you can set any of the options to a random choice for a more exciting, unpredictable game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,
