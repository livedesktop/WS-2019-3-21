My bird has a huge passion for mini golf but there are no golf clubs (sticks) and balls to play with, he has reinvented the game concept.\r\nHe blows up his clumsy body until he looks like a ball and uses a slingshot to move towards the hole.\r\nAfter the first shot the game play will change from slingshot modus to arrow modus with a power bar, for a more precise stroke.\r\nAdvice: Remember that the first hit will be the most difficult, so do not put too much strength in it because it will simply make our fluffy friend, fly out of the track. Don't hit the bird into the sea - it doesn't like to be a subsurfer...\r\n\r\nCool gamefeat:\r\n- Awesome 3D graphics\r\n- Cute animal characters and animations with dancing birds\r\n- 4 fun courses with over 70 holes\r\n- Simple, drag-and-release gameplay mechanic for the slingshot\r\n- Direction arrow with power bar for the successive stroke - just touch it\r\n- Realistic physics and ball movement\r\n- Collectible coins and jewels to increase your score\r\n- Easy and funny to play\r\n\r\nTry to find the shortest and easiest path to the hole in order to rise your score. Let's make it with no more than 3 par (hits) and you will get three stars.\r\nThere are also collectible coins and jewels that can increase your final score like crazy.\r\n\r\nIf you collect one gem you will get back one par (stroke) which means that you have higher possibilities to get 3 stars.\r\n\r\nEnjoy hours of fun with this challenging free app!

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG1V9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The Secret Society -

The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode.

Score strikes, spares, and turkeys.\r\n\r\nPICK UP SPARES\r\n\r\nPractice challenging spares. Clear stages to unlock new balls.\r\n\r\nONE HUNDRED PINS\r\n\r\nKnock down as many pins as you can in 5 throws at a rack of 100 pins!\r\n\r\nCANDLEPIN BOWLING\r\n\r\nInvented in 1880. Candlepin bowling offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others.

In a single player mode, person is always down (blue) regardless of who is moving first. Pieces move diagonally on the dark squares and opponents' pieces are captured by jumping over them to an unoccupied square. Capturing is mandatory. When multiple capture sequence is available, player may choose the sequence but have to make all available captures. When men reach the farthest row forward, they become kings, enabling them to move backwards. \r\nThere are three different modes: \r\n- English Draughts - pieces can't jump back and Kings can only move one stop in either direction. \r\n- Flying Kings - pieces can't jump back but Kings can can move as far as they want along unblocked diagonals (also known as Spanish, Czech, Argentinian, Thai, Turkish). \r\n- International - pieces can jump back and Kings can can move as far as they want along unblocked diagonals (also known as Brazilian, Russian shashki, Pool checkers). \r\n\r\nPieces are moved by first selecting (tap) the piece to move and then selecting (tap) the cell to move to. If there is only one available move for selected piece, it will move by automatically (no second tap needed).

An early variant of Tic-tac-toe was played in Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called Terni Lapilli and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. However, there is some evidence to suggest that Tic-Tac-Toe could originate back to ancient Egypt. \r\nThe different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to \"noughts and crosses\", the British name, appeared in 1864. The first print reference to a game called \"tick-tack-toe\" occurred in 1884, but referred to \"a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored\". \"Tic-tac-toe\" may also derive from \"tick-tack\", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of noughts and crosses as tic-tac-toe occurred in the 20th century. \r\nWhen playing against a phone, human player is always 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Using menu button, game can be configured to play on the larger boards to connect 4 pieces, or between 2 people.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLZ0N","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spider (Free)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31670.9007199266438783.608d1e9f-946a-475c-8fa3-fb013108b76f.d1a00048-bf4e-4380-b822-47b4f734b416","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12759.9007199266438783.76a8d8d5-0839-40d7-afb8-c18936974284.c1e10216-8b84-4a70-a801-e9c6f03ab92a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GASPMobileGamesInc.SpiderFree_9haz0p453120e"],"ContentIds":["36c317a0-65c4-4f2d-0019-1053e835a3a3","9316fd81-8525-e96a-d197-14cf6648a3fd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The most popular version of Spider Solitaire was introduced in Windows 98. The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDM5M0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fulgore Trainer","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29149.9007199266445105.2a34b549-5349-48d2-a370-a0df5ad7f677.f6632e4b-1602-4a8d-a198-8d3d3b720ef0","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33509.9007199266445105.c81e86da-e9d6-45ca-9db8-5ed74a6335de.e9f90605-b2ac-4960-a20d-47dbda55d5e8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30944.9007199266445105.e689726f-39bc-48b6-94a8-78ef90c16885.61c314e5-fdd4-40c7-87a3-ba6c69963f2b","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["37262DancingChimps.FulgoreTrainer_ys9a80gm9xb10"],"ContentIds":["0b548c3f-73d8-875e-ad82-fdbf04aba359","2cfb3fb1-a815-3ada-9f73-3406c82f9dfe"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you keep getting beaten by Fulgore in Killer Instinct on Xbox One, this app will help you train to identify his auto doubles.\r\nMimic the action on the right thumbstick of your controller by swiping up, down, left and right to break the combos that Fulgore throws your way.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDM83R","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Malware Defense","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44108.9007199266446974.7f4db524-c9a4-43da-811f-038c97d4c639.e0ee19fe-a3cc-408d-a651-b8b6a8d6f355","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18256.9007199266446974.3799d3c9-3d4e-4ca4-b3cc-d3804449dbbd.e4ce3c10-c374-45d6-8928-e687a8750434","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["13346ATVProduction.DefenseoftheMalware_xxfkq25b9ybge"],"ContentIds":["1fdbec80-7eab-5ca8-2978-b7c921b01958"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Malware begin to attack our system.

Playing this game is rather simple: Move the bird on the twig by using your mouse or simply touching the screen. Once you have positioned the bird click below the twig and bird drop will start falling although not quite according to the laws of physics which I must admit. It is all about timing: You will get more points if you position the bird as far left as possible and if you hit the car close to the rear. If you trigger too early you can deploy a parachute slicing the speed of decent by half. This however will reduce the points you may gather by 50%. If you click a third time the parachute will disappear and the bird drop will fall at its original speed. But if you do so you will only collect 25% of the possible points. Not dropping at all will cost you 100 points from your cumulative score. A simple and fun game for kids! An absurd game for adults – if you are in the right mood...   ;-)\r\n(en-us, 1.1.0.9)","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDNB8X","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"*Mine Sweeper","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15312.9007199266466131.661d4b0e-803c-49e7-b98f-0b5013de50c0.d8362def-9d03-4ab5-98eb-feeb0caa2091","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61468.9007199266466131.661d4b0e-803c-49e7-b98f-0b5013de50c0.679cdeb7-d869-466a-8844-fe2829a2347a","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["12291raymond.li.MineSweeper_szs6zaftcmqhc"],"ContentIds":["c7718f4d-5f26-212c-a165-8f3140fbc8fb","85580725-5af9-c764-de39-c2c8391f35a8","e5a7a738-b019-19fa-855e-e5591ad61a60"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"*MineSweeper is a deceptively simple test of memory and reasoning—and one of the most popular windows games of all time.

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics.

Compete against players from around the world in a high speed online race.\r\n\r\nFUN DRIVING \r\nTraffic Race 3D 2 is a mixture of arcade racing and casual driving on open tracks. No more re-spawns when you hit the race track border. Go crazy and find the fastest route on each track. \r\n\r\nENDLESS RUNNER GAME MODE \r\nWe’ve invented a combination of endless running mode with a checkpoint system. You will not die because you crash, your car will take damage but just keep on going for as far as you can! \r\n\r\nGLOBAL HIGH SCORE\r\nAre you the best driver in the world? Now you can prove it! Show the world that you are the next Schumacher or Hamilton. Can you make it to 1st place in the global rank? We reset ranks every week on Mondays to keep the competition alive.  \r\n\r\nARCADE RACING PHYSICS\r\nWe’ve taken inspiration from all extreme motor sports: Nascar, F1, Le mans, Rally and then we’ve stripped it down to a casual driving experience. This lets you drift around corners at 240 km/h with your car while still having fun and do crash as often as you wish. \r\n\r\nSUITABLE FOR ALL AGES (PEGI 3)\r\nEveryone can enjoy Traffic Race 3D 2. You will actually probably become a better real driver regardless if you are an adult, teenager or child. \r\n\r\nINTUITIVE CONTROLS\r\nThe goal of this game is to make it easy and fast to run on any device (Mobile, PC, Tablet). \r\n\r\nCAMERA OF YOUR CHOICE\r\nWe’ve added the opportunity for you to switch camera mode between Chase, Helicopter or cockpit view so you really feel that you are driving a real car.  \r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE – AI DRIVERS\r\nOur game includes AI drivers but our drivers are not perfect. They make mistakes and will not always stay on the track, probably just like you :o)\r\n\r\n100% FREE – WE PROMISE\r\nYou can unlock all cars and courses for free. You do not need to buy any smurf coins to play this game. Each time you race you gain coins to unlock cars. Courses can only be unlocked by achieving the best times on each track.  We do offer one IAP and we call it “All Inclusive”, it gives you all cars and eliminates all ads. \r\n\r\nFEEDBACK\r\nWe are listening to feedback from our users. If you want to see specific feature or improvements let us know by writing a review. We're a indie game developer so every review counts and helps!\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US\r\n* https://twitter.com/cg_fred\r\n\r\n\"Probably the best mobile racing game ever\" - that is our goal :)\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIEWS\r\nHere are some great reviews that we've received on Windows Phone.\r\n\r\n* “Awesome game!!! Even better than the first one!”\r\n* “It's the first app I update in 2016!

You can then use either touch, or the Xbox 360 controller, keyboard and/or the mouse to fly.\r\n\r\nThe assets used in this game is created by me, and downloaded from the Unity Asset Store.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ9WM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Microsoft Bingo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10830.9007199266251894.2addb906-a153-4170-aaa4-d2af9f899d47.23edd399-67e0-40cd-83c8-f7334fd1a502","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7679.9007199266251894.1f501570-a57b-4beb-9fe5-ae3adbdfdc27.b8ab3ec8-0e29-4e29-aa9d-aa6149e55c00","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20090.9007199266251894.ceeed96f-b7f4-40e7-bf62-4da4b5eae17a.8b500323-8353-45f5-ad66-dabd227edf1a","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30745.9007199266251894.d41c68f8-a162-4716-bb58-dbf323128fe8.57778567-903d-4fcc-8200-4989cbdffa19","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1052.9007199266251894.e0981686-8f96-442b-a55d-01d78de0f5ba.2a2feab7-7160-41f1-9e4e-0312bf280ba2","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65535.9007199266251894.6ef30594-bfd6-40f3-81e3-05e1fb161a68.e03233eb-8358-4456-bca4-b97cf1cf8860","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15067.9007199266251894.1ecbc979-577e-413e-8045-4f20c5145402.21ce5c2f-7ed9-43cf-8688-cf56585e58db","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35496.9007199266251894.9b912cfe-3484-4ce6-8588-70a8c8816787.0b226f36-91ac-4121-aeef-ed07865541ac","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42966.9007199266251894.08970b3e-a161-4dfb-a8d5-56569104db2e.1152d4dd-3d56-4ff3-8361-1d8bac621188","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58161.9007199266251894.c0a93fa1-87da-4395-8a7f-1005f78e6338.8f9f8e90-15df-4fe9-91a5-159a9b80469f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#318FB7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.MicrosoftBingo_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["112ed009-05f6-72ae-08d5-7841c77aeb8a","1775d1da-125f-6de5-bd3c-ed5e8f975996","40fac71a-5314-e309-ea87-85a11787639a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"BINGO! \r\n\r\nDust off your daubers.
