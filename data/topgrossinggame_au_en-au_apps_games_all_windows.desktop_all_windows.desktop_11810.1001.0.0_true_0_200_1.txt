This is an excellent family story with a paranormal twist!\r\n\r\nYour family’s past is more interesting than any story. And it's not over yet...\r\n \r\nOne of my father’s stories was my favorite: “Once upon a time there lived a merchant with his wife. The family was happy and had never known grief. However, their maid, Julianne, was jealous of the little family's happiness and secretly dreamed of taking the place of a beloved wife. She learned of unholy powers hidden deep within the manor that could be summoned by a ritual … although there was a cost. She cursed the merchant's wife, unleashed deadly powers. The merchant vows to devote the rest of his life to finding a way to release his beloved wife from her cursed world.”\r\n\r\nYears have passed. My father dies, but he leaves me a message: “Your favorite fairy tale was the true story of our family. I tried to free your mother's spirit, but I failed. I beg you to finish what I could not. The solution is waiting in our old family home.”\r\n\r\nAs a son, I must “write” the happy ending for my family’s story.\r\n\r\nThis puzzle adventure is perfect for playing while traveling.

You create a new astronaut, gain levels and experience for every move you make by completing missions in space. You will have access to missions similar to what happened in real life, or fictional missions designed to challenge you as an astronaut.\r\n\r\nSpacecrafts are highly complicated machines with the primary task of exploring and understanding what's outside the atmosphere of Earth, while keeping the astronauts alive for long periods. This is achieved by hundreds of individual systems and backup systems working together. With the help from the in-game Space Flight Academy, the provided flight manual for each spacecraft, and checklists, you will learn how to fly and operate these machines, and explore space in a high resolution and realistic environment.\r\n\r\nControl almost every system like the real astronauts, see the sunset and sunrise while orbiting orbiting Earth with speeds exceeding 25,500 ft/s. Explore the surface of Earth and the Moon with high resolution textures, or simply enjoy the solitude of being in space.\r\n\r\nImagine the final few seconds before launching into space. You are sitting on top of a 111 meter high rocket, looking at the instruments of a spaceship about to leave the oasis we call Earth. The engines are igniting, mechanical systems are clinging below you, while thousands of gallons of fuel is pumping through the systems. The loud roar of the five F1 engines are producing close to 8,000,000 pounds of thrust, violently shaking the cockpit and lifting 3 million kg off the pad. The launch pad tower is slowly moving away from you while the engines are balancing the rocket like a skyscraper on a needle.

Take control of a whole country, like the USA, Germany, France, Russia, or Austria. Change laws, taxes and budgets based on real world statistics and data, and see what happens.\r\n\r\nThe game simulates a whole country: Population, debt, GDP, economic growth, unemployment, crime, life expectancy, birth rate, mortality rate, state of the infrastructure and so on. The player can adjust budgets, taxes, laws, and see what the outcome is. \r\n\r\nReal World Data\r\n\r\nThe game is running on real-world data. Meaning everything is based on real values: If you play as the USA, the debt, income, expenditures, crime rate, unemployment rate, etc. you start with is based on the actual, real values of the USA. For example if you lower a tax rate, you'll see what the simulation calculates as new values afterwards, in dollars, people, crimes per 100.000, interest rate, life expectancy in years, and similar.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n\r\nThere are goals to fulfill, like decreasing the crime rate or achieving a certain public health or education rating, but it is already interesting to try to tamper with the various options alone: What happens if you lower the minimum wage? What if you change the length of maternity leave? Or the retirement age? You can also do more serious changes like introducing censorship laws, compulsory military service, cash bans, or universal basic income.\r\n\r\nThere are military options, so you can start a war with any country in the world, and adjust its operation mode while the conflict is active. But be sure not to let it run out of control. Some countries for example also have a nuclear option, of course.\r\n\r\nThe game also includes a media and public relations system, where you can read the most interesting headlines, and try to influence the media with PR stunts, interviews, and similar. \r\n\r\nCountries\r\n\r\nYou can play as the USA, Germany, Russia, France, and Austria: These are the countries the simulation was implemented and tested to work nicely. But there are also additional countries and scenarios which can be downloaded. It is also possible to create new countries and scenarios on your own and share them with others.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NXX7DQFDWZJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dead Reckoning: Brassfield Manor","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1663.14487379304855797.22a9620d-205b-4bc6-8034-c4f60c3e04f7.c85074fd-39c8-469a-85dc-d6e6444e7660","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23826.14487379304855797.22a9620d-205b-4bc6-8034-c4f60c3e04f7.8439182b-214f-445f-9b17-d7edadda0d8d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18079.14487379304855797.22a9620d-205b-4bc6-8034-c4f60c3e04f7.d0996b11-b4f3-4045-8297-12821d9dd38b","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34444.14487379304855797.22a9620d-205b-4bc6-8034-c4f60c3e04f7.a4315c71-1e16-4fa1-a8f8-c5b91f80e581","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$14.95","Price":14.95,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BigFishGames.DeadReckoningBrassfieldManor_bsrvrvej7yy2w"],"ContentIds":["651e8ef6-fbb6-d17d-161f-f1db261e04f8"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"From Eipix Entertainment, makers of Dead Reckoning: Silvermoon Isle and the Final Cut series!\r\n\r\nOn the eve of his annual murder mystery party, wealthy businessman Reginald Greer is found dead at his home.

Vince’s adventure takes him from the streets of New Orleans to the depths of a Louisiana bayou to find the whereabouts of his keeper, Madam Charmaine.\r\n\r\nIn true voodoo style, Vince encounters and defeats quirky monsters and villains ... by kicking his own butt! By racing under a falling safe, jumping into a high-speed blender, or leaping under falling rubble, Vince is sure to defeat his enemies—all while managing to escape completely unscathed.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n• Voodoo combat action: Players can employ more than 30 voodoo attacks that do outrageous things to Vince, but it's the monsters who end up hurting! Unlike in other games, players must actually USE dangers and hazards, instead of running from them. Falling safes, prickly pushpins, and bolts of lightning bring a whole new meaning to the phrase \"no pain, no gain.\" \r\n\r\n• Magical voodoo world: Thrust into the depths of a twisted and dangerous world, Vince must trek through 30 detailed levels, including crawfish-laden swamps, a graveyard filled with imps and lost zombies, a fantastic French Quarter, and a network of boggy sewers. \r\n\r\n• Vehicles and minigames: As the game unfolds, Vince must master and pilot a number of vehicles, including a fanboat, a submarine, an airplane—and even a rat gives him a lift at one point. Vince must master one mind-bending minigame after another to complete his quest. \r\n\r\n• Dynamic cast of characters: No adventure would be complete without its host of surly characters. Offbeat creatures with all the charm of New Orleans are around every corner. Vince encounters everything from Ginger Dead Men (who are not exactly sugar-coated) to a pair of intoxicated gas pumps that offer up a fiery challenge.\r\n\r\nSupports Xbox Play Anywhere: yours to play on both Xbox One and Windows 10 PC at no additional cost.\r\n\r\nSupports Xbox Live features including earning achievements and sharing game

Players within a partnership face each other across a table. Traditionally, the players are referred to by the points of the compass - North, East, South and West. The two partnerships are North/South and East/West. \r\n\r\nIn Rubber Bridge a rubber is played as the best of three games. A game is won by the first partnership to score 100 or more points in successful contracts.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago Bridge you play four hands of Bridge. The winner is the partnership that scores the most points in those hands.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ23Z","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The Chess Lv.100","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37516.9007199266242760.0f1b6e53-b961-4a29-bafc-f343da271220.4f9f31eb-2d77-4651-b6c6-ea82ac755f44","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15853.9007199266242760.64165bbf-8789-4b3c-8d20-107e101d06f7.ed546b53-4318-4156-be01-10a59b78784c","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14909.9007199266242760.c3e6f9d5-430e-48e7-a730-fb40d68d4a14.def4b2e1-7332-4762-b6f8-3048befd8b4a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13516.9007199266242760.46637344-631e-4753-a29b-9c9ed8c80fef.0f6bdee6-3246-45d6-8551-bf8ca8114088","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60167.9007199266242760.88501219-9d54-468d-9b95-78370d60d857.ca00cabe-7b17-4af3-b863-682426fe33d0","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24473.9007199266242760.e8740b7a-01ca-428f-b977-d455f6784316.b52a5f0c-e26e-4071-8d7f-4c92a8f7840c","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14909.9007199266242760.c3e6f9d5-430e-48e7-a730-fb40d68d4a14.def4b2e1-7332-4762-b6f8-3048befd8b4a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"231","PackageFamilyNames":["6918E89D.TheChessLv.100_66n08swfvvka0"],"ContentIds":["fc08c624-2462-1a5b-59b8-222a59374d72","a391471d-a2d6-8fe0-920c-3558787a243c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The Chess Lv.100 is the most downloaded chess app for Windows Store!

Stress tests reveal whether the bridge you build can withstand the daily stress of continual use from cars, trucks and, more recently, super-heavy tank trucks.\r\n\r\nYou can choose between a range of materials for each individual bridge, such as wood, steel, cables, or concrete pillars. Use the appropriate materials and stay within budget to build the perfect bridge. The choice of different materials means that there are numerous solutions and approaches and you can build each bridge in any number of ways – your budget is the only limit. The refined grid system allows you to realize your idea of the perfect bridge with even more precision. Let your imagination and creativity run free! And if you happen to run into a dead end, you can pick up valuable tips from the brand new help system!\r\n\r\nAvailable ingame: SlopeMania!\r\nIn the SlopeMania add-on you find yourself on the Tiltin Islands, home to three brand new islands where you'll even be building your bridges inside colorful grottoes! The 24 tricky, never-before-seen levels will have you using sloping lanes to overcome the massive height differences.

Plan is a puzzle adventure game that takes place entirely inside an elevator. Go floor to floor, find items, and meet a bizarre cast of characters.

Walk around the elevator, grab things, and press buttons! Or if you'd rather enjoy your buttons from a distance, you can play seated or standing with a variety of control options. \r\n\r\nClassic Genre, New Paint\r\nFloor Plan takes mechanics from your favorite classic point-and-click adventure games and reimagines them for first person VR. Whether you dream of inventory puzzles or you're a newcomer to the genre, you'll see it like you've never seen it before.\r\n\r\nPlay Your Way\r\nFigure out alternate solutions to puzzles, solve them in different orders, or call the operator if you need a nudge in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT\r\nFloor Plan generally takes players about an hour to complete. We've priced it accordingly, and think it has enough special moments to be memorable and something you'll want to share with friends.

How long can you survive the arena? Smell the petrol fumes and enjoy the destruction!\r\n\r\nSome of the awesome features of this game:\r\n- Many tracks and race events\r\n- Intense destruction and racing action\r\n- Realistic car damage\r\n- Choose between various all American muscle cars\r\n- Customize and improve your car by earning or buying upgrades\r\n- Choose and modify your car control system to your own preference\r\n- Next to pure demolition events you can race on ovals and dirt tracks\r\n- Smooth 3D graphics and sound effects\r\n\r\nGet ready to race and destroy your opponents in demolition derbies and track races (mini ovals and dirt tracks included) that will offer you the thrill of a lifetime. Destruction has never felt so real as you see doors and other car parts smash of your car. \r\n\r\nSome game-play tips:\r\nHave fun smashing and destroying your adversaries, but understand that the game is a quite accurate simulation of the real thing! In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference. Always try to smash rivals in the side of their vehicle or from the rear. Head-on collisions on the other hand should be avoided. Practice makes perfect!\r\n\r\nUpgrades:\r\nYou have various cars you can unlock. These all have the pros and cons. Be sure to upgrade your cars wisely as the various type of events require different cars. Use armor upgrades to strengthen your endurance; or engine upgrades to boost your speed. To get your upgrades you earn money during races. The better you perform the more you earn. Before a race you can also buy power-ups to boost your performance during a race. The nitro boost will allow you to accelerate super-fast and smash your opponents even harder; or choose one of the other power-ups such an armor booster to strengthen your car during the race.
