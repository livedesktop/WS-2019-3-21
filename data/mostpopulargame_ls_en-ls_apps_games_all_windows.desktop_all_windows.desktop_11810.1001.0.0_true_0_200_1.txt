Kids enjoy playing these games for hours without getting bored, and at the same time learning skills, which are carefully incorporated in the design of each game. \r\n\r\nWhat makes this app special is that so many different types of games are present in a single place, which are normally found in separate different apps.\r\n\r\nGames are designed to enhance following skills:\r\n  1. Basic mathematics\r\n  2. Numbers recognition\r\n  3. Hand-eye coordination\r\n  4. Concentration\r\n  5. Visual perception\r\n  6. Vocabulary\r\n  7. Classification\r\n  8. Symmetry\r\n  9.

If kid is interested more in some types of games, he/she can skip the ones he/she doesn't want.\r\n\r\nTo keep kids challenged, points are awarded for each game stage completed. A scoreboard is maintained which kid can see after each game. When kid scores enough points, he/she earns a sticker of his/her choice. All his/her earned stickers are kept in a box which he/she can relish any time they want later.\r\n\r\nWe have put our every effort to make this app interesting and beautiful.

The four in a row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.\r\n* The first player to get four in a row wins. \r\n* If the board is filled with discs and neither player has four in a row, then the game is a draw.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCJG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spider Solitaire Collection Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30186.9007199266251693.bb4553e8-86e7-4b65-a9bb-6ccdeefd7c17.7029e085-f4cb-4e12-87fa-02b34ae24bc4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16164.9007199266251693.66ae06c0-6c6e-4e12-9ca1-a4924d81279d.89b01d1e-ced4-41aa-89a0-5394eda92e87","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13860.9007199266251693.07fcfec6-96ef-4efa-ad1f-f58d3fc2cf71.54beb575-389f-4e45-8761-065ae2353863","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60912.9007199266251693.22012260-3791-462d-92ff-332d36a0745e.f2c61312-addc-411f-a884-31371d573bee","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9171.9007199266251693.dadf7317-414c-4739-9d67-5e0d6b1e029b.2a6ca758-fe2b-43fb-9718-976ff9c25668","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4931.9007199266251693.c9425b5b-a57a-430e-a7ad-7992c64aaaee.215790f5-62b6-4aa1-bb32-5c3d80095267","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22327.9007199266251693.04d1c893-44fa-4f36-9f6d-e71941f601e8.25aad5f8-30e4-4d0b-9216-6382050bcfa5","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60399.9007199266251693.31a64ec2-546a-4571-9bd9-5f87f0029533.9097ab22-6ae5-480e-b833-01bc7f90409a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1C9558","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55753.9007199266251693.923bd944-547f-4039-81b7-88ed123a189c.cda166b8-cb6d-4628-8a7c-51782b6b6ebf","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["TreeCardGames.SpiderSolitaireCollectionFree_n666hb6ddc5jp"],"ContentIds":["b8f1098c-a6ee-4b90-e51d-1342746aafd9","9d7c8ccf-c695-298c-1f82-2d4a6c7b9645","630f6217-a186-344c-ff87-8f382dbec7ab"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play a free beautiful collection of Spider solitaire game variations, including:\r\n- Spider\r\n- Spider One Suit\r\n- Spider Two Suits\r\n- Scorpion\r\n\r\nWe support our apps and your feedback is welcome.

What he didn't say is that intuition is in fact a learned skill.  One that requires years of study and practice; making decisions and feeling the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat; over and over again.  For someone determined to be a successful trader that can mean a very long period of losses before you acquire the insight to become consistently profitable.\r\n\r\nNot any more!  With Fast Trading you can build your trader's intuition in a fraction of the time.  And completely risk free.  Fast Trading is a greatly accelerated \"learn by doing\" game that lets you practice trading financial products using historical data.  Decisions and results are exactly as they would be in actual trading, except that a day of trading is condensed into a five minute game.  Feedback is immediate.  Not only do you see your trading account balance change, but we have developed Tradr IQ, an Elo type rating system so you will know how you fare over time (and compared to others). The Fear and Greed meter identifies whether you are exiting winners too early or hanging on to losers too long. If a person applies their serious attention to this game for a few months, they will develop an intuition for trading that would previously have been possible only with many years of practical experience.\r\n\r\nPlus it is fun!  Compare results with your friends.  See who can be the first to achieve the level of International Grandmaster.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NRPV82FF0FX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Iron Blade: Medieval Legends RPG","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8378.14378593879671853.93680d1c-9bae-4c4b-bdac-3ceeef991ae5.40e28fb7-2c1c-4243-8833-ccf3bcefc143","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17599.14378593879671853.93680d1c-9bae-4c4b-bdac-3ceeef991ae5.db3892ba-bb8f-4f68-9aa4-d03b8fafd847","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17001.14378593879671853.4f1c1151-efed-4422-9b7e-72a3b68a376a.272c4690-3562-4978-82ad-09972bf26a7f","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["A278AB0D.IronBlade_h6adky7gbf63m"],"ContentIds":["3c3119c5-727d-c99b-05d5-1ff85887313c","3738255a-3267-a101-6547-07ebe54e2700"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"...
