Deep snow has made it very difficult & dangerous to drive on the narrow roads of the city and off road tracks have become even more risky.

Snowy Bus Drive is a challenging game testing driving skills in risky and dangerous conditions and difficult paths.

Beautiful flowers make them feel the joys of spring, and the painting process turns into an enthralling game where they can bring their fantasies to life and draw a red daffodil, or a blue sunflower.\r\n\r\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\r\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

This is a shortened version of the “Nature for Tots” app.\r\n \r\nTogether with your child, you can watch wonderful images of fruits and vegetables, all while learning their names!\r\n\r\nAfter the child has looked through all the flashcards, he or she can take a fun quiz to see how many of the words he or she knows. Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child's developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThis educational application contains full set of “Fruits” and “Vegetables” flashcards from the “Nature for Kids” application. In addition, it includes the clipped demo sets of the following groups of educational cards: “Berries”, “Flowers”, “Mushrooms”, “Nature” (sea, island, forest, river, mountain, etc.), “Seasons”, “Natural phenomena” (rain, rainbow, lightning, etc.).\r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! Besides English, this app also supports the German, Russian and Ukrainian languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their foreign language teachers and classmates. An A+ is sure to follow! \r\n\r\nIn order to use this educational app, the youngster does not need to be able to read. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently!\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain.

Backgammon is a board game in which you move the pieces around the board according to dice rolls. Once you get all the pieces in the house you take them out according to your dice. The first player to get all the pieces out wins the game.\r\nDownload and play now!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ challenging AI\r\n\r\n✓ auto bear off\r\n\r\n✓ easy to select and move pieces\r\n\r\n✓ fluid animations \r\n\r\n✓ HD graphics\r\n\r\n✓ detailed statistics\r\n\r\n✓ nice music and sound effects\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Your pieces are white and your opponent's pieces are black. There are 24 places on the board and two places to deposit the pieces. The 24 places are represented as triangles and called points. So the 1-point is the first place where pieces can stay. \r\n\r\n✓ The points from 1 to 6 are called the opponents’ home and the points from 19 to 24 are your home on the board. The opponent needs to bring all his pieces in the home region in order to take them out and so do you.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move around the board in one direction. You move from the bottom-right corner to the bottom-left corner then to the top-left corner and finally to the top-right corner on a path that resembles a horseshoe. The points from 1 to 24 follow this path in the same direction. Your opponent moves in the opposite direction following this path. \r\n\r\n✓ The game starts with a couple of dice rolls that decide which player should begin first. The opponent rolls first, then you. The one with the biggest pips’ count on the dice starts first. A pip is a dot on the face of a dice which counts as a point of movement or placement.\r\n\r\n✓ When your turn comes you start by rolling the dice and continue by making the moves.\r\n\r\n✓ If you roll a double your pips count will be twice the pips�� sum of the dice.\r\n\r\n✓ After you roll the dice some top pieces on your triangles, will be highlighted. You can start your move with any of those highlighted pieces. To move the pieces, you select the piece by tapping on the triangle on which it lies. Then, at that point the triangle turns blue and the places to which you can move next turn green. Tap on any of those green triangles to initiate the move. When the move ends and if there are moves left on the dice new pieces will be highlighted.\r\n\r\n✓ If one of your dice is one you can move one of your pieces only one position. If the piece lies on 2-point you can move it on 3-point for example. If you roll a double, you can make four moves with the same value of the dice from that roll.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move your pieces to columns occupied by your pieces, to empty places or places in which your opponent has one piece. \r\n\r\n✓ If you move your piece over the opponent's single piece you can capture it.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ31N","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Backgammon Pro","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.57265.9007199266246025.5ad63fcf-8d02-4566-81d3-397e78178cd1.cb8fdf32-a0b7-4c60-9b49-32b1aa5b4d81","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#D19048","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.41606.9007199266246025.44ca9a04-8539-4c1e-a54c-de230319be70.458e4118-0473-4ae9-9f4b-d94a506b34b6","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#D19048","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.33872.9007199266246025.11fa2e10-ab50-4655-a5ec-4aa7d8a7115c.1c1c15f0-9855-4a14-89bd-a4a4764f8f8e","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#D19048","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.42630.9007199266246025.baf06a62-a5ad-47ce-8737-737bd4c5e268.a70dd46c-bc22-4284-952d-14344e98bff3","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#D19048","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2874.9007199266246025.fa8c6e22-bccc-413a-b606-b73cbde5bcd5.846416c5-74e7-4ce9-96bb-24cf01bccfea","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#D19048","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.7,"RatingsCount":"6","PackageFamilyNames":["32988BernardoZamora.BackgammonPro_1fgex2kbsn6g8"],"ContentIds":["815ec9ff-a10d-5311-302b-07c76638f763","827ea93b-ea4c-b309-419e-0885b76c550f","12d5e003-452e-e458-57d1-90ed1c5de349"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The #1 most downloaded Backgammon app, THANK YOU!\r\n\r\nBackgammon is a board game where two players compete to get all their 15 pieces off the board before the opponent.

thriving metropolis. Attack bloon-infested territory adjacent to your city, win a short tower defense game, and add the captured territory to your city as a space on which to build. Buildings are the heart of your city, and each one has a specific purpose - individual monkey towers for battle, upgrades for those towers, farms and banks to drive your economy, power to supercharge your city, epic buildings for epic powers, and decorations to make your city more awesome. Every time you build, your city looks cooler, you increase your power potential in tower defense play, and you open up even more rewards and challenges.\r\n\r\nAMAZING DEPTH AND VARIETY\r\nAll 21 of the fully awesomized and carefully balanced Bloons TD 5 towers are available within Monkey City, with completely new unlock mechanics. More than 130 buildings and decorations give you endless strategies and city design options. Explore the wilderness to find treasure tiles and uncover 11 powerful special items like the Banana Replicator and the Dark Temple Idol. Burst bloons on 55 all new tower defense maps or test your mastery on 13 wildly challenging original special missions. Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\r\n\r\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\r\nConnect with Facebook friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\r\n\r\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\r\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and play Bloons Monkey City now!\r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\nBloons Monkey City is free to download and play (aside from internet, carrier, data, device, and other services for which the player is financially responsible), but some in-game items can be purchased with real money.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

The game is also known as The Dirty, Black Lady, Chase the Lady, Crubs, and Black Maria, though any of these may refer to the similar but differently-scored game Black Lady. The game is regarded as a member of the Whist family of trick-taking games (which also includes Bridge and Spades), but the game is unique among Whist variants in that it is an evasion-type game. The object of the game is to avoid taking points. When the first player reaches 100 points, the player with the lowest number of points is the winner. \r\n\r\nIn hearts each heart card is worth 1 point and the queen of spades is worth 13 points, which is as much as all of the other cards combined. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of round, the players choose three cards to pass to a random player. The player with the 2 of clubs must lead the first trick with the 2 of clubs. For each trick a player must follow suit unless he does not have a card of that suit. Because there is no trump, a player can not win a trick if he passes a card of any suit other than the suit lead. Hearts can not be lead until hearts are broken - after the first heart card has been played. If a player takes every point in a round, he “Shoots the Moon” and he receives 0 points for the round while all other players receive 26 points.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped.
